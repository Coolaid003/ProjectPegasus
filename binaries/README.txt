In order to download homebrew through the client you first need to create a folder 
called homebrew in C:/Users/Public ProjectPegasus will download your files here.
After doing this you will now be able to download homebrew through the Client.
Once you have downloaded your selected homebrew through the client, just extract the files and you're good to go.

In order to run you will need to download and install mono. 
Just do sudo apt-get install mono. To run the client just cd into
the binaries folder and run in the terminal  mono  Project_Pegasus.exe
For extracting the files I recommend either unzip or unrar. 

Note: In order to extract the download archive with unrar or unzip make sure 
and add an extra / in the path. So for instance if you download psx-box instead of
typing C:\Users\Public\psx-box-master.zip  unzip

You would type
C:\\Users\\Public\\psx-box-master.zip unzip
