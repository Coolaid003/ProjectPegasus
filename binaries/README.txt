In order to run you will need to download and install mono. 
Just do sudo apt-get install mono. To run the client just cd into
the binaries folder and run in the terminal  mono  Project_Pegasus.exe
For extracting the files I recommend either unzip or unrar. 

Note: In order to extract the download archive from the terminal with unrar or unzip 
make sure and add an extra / in the path. So for instance if you download psx-box instead of
typing unzip C:\Users\Public\psx-box-master.zip  

You would type
unzip C:\\Users\\Public\\psx-box-master.zip
