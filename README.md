of the internet or scroll through pages of forum threads, this utility provides a
simple way to download any and all Xbox One homebrew right to your PC.

# Does it work on Linux/Mac ?
Currently as of now it works only the Windows Operating System. However C# Code runs on Linux and Mac with Mono
so it should be very trivial to include support for Mac/Linux systems in the near future.
