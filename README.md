# What Platforms does this tool support?
Currently ProjectPegasus runs on Windows Linux and Mac. For Windows you can use the 
standalone EXE. For Linux and Mac computers we provide a working bash script. If 
using the shell script please be aware it does require Curl to be installed.
Credit goes to jackb994 for the script.
