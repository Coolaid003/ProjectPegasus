# ProjectPegasus
ProjectPegasus is a command-line client that serves as a single collective for
all known Xbox One homebrew. Rather than having to search through various corners
of the internet or scroll through pages of forum threads, this utility provides a
simple way to download any and all Xbox One homebrew right to your PC.

# Does it work on Linux/Mac ?
Currently as of now it works on Windows and Linux(With Mono). After downloading 
Project Pegasus from Github Just do sudo apt-get install mono-complete to install mono.
In order to run just locate where you downloaded Project Pegasus at and change to the binaries
directory. Then just type mono Project_Pegasus.exe and it will start.Mac should work with Mono 
as well although I haven't tested it on Mac myself personally to verify.


# A word of advice for Windows Users
In order to use the tool with windows you must first create a folder called homebrew 
inside of your C:\Users\Public Directory. This is where ProjectPegasus will download 
your files to. This is not necessary with Linux as the homebrew automatically downloads
to the binaries folder.
