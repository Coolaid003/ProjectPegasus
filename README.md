# ProjectPegasus
ProjectPegasus is a command-line client that serves as a single collective for
all known Xbox One homebrew. Rather than having to search through various corners
of the internet or scroll through pages of forum threads, this utility provides a
simple way to download any and all Xbox One homebrew right to your PC.

# What Platforms does this tool support?
Currently ProjectPegasus runs on Windows Linux and Mac. Running on Linux/Mac
requires mono to be installed. Please see the readme in the binaries folder for more
platform specific information. Additionaly if mono isn't really your cup of tea we 
now provide a shell script which you can find in the "scripts" directory. The shell
script provides all of the same functionality and has no dependencies other than curl.
Credit goes to jackb994 for the script.
