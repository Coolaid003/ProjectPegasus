# ProjectPegasus
ProjectPegasus is a command-line client that serves as a single collective for
all known Xbox One homebrew. Rather than having to search through various corners
of the internet or scroll through pages of forum threads, this utility provides a
simple way to download any and all Xbox One homebrew right to your PC.

# Does it work on Linux/Mac ?
Currently as of now it works only the Windows Operating System. However C# Code runs on Linux and Mac with Mono
so it should be very trivial to include support for Mac/Linux systems in the near future.

# A word of advice
In order to use the tool you must first create a folder called homebrew inside of your
C:\Users\Public Directory. This is where ProjectPegasus will download your files to.
