ProjectPegasus is a client that serves as a single collective for
all known Xbox One homebrew. Rather than having to search through various corners
of the internet or scroll through several pages of forum threads, this utility provides a
simple way to download any and all Xbox One homebrew right to your PC.

Currently ProjectPegasus runs on Windows Linux and Mac. For Windows I have provided an easy to use installer. For Linux and Mac computers there is a working bash script. If 
using the shell script please be aware it does require Curl to be installed.
Credit goes to jackb994 for the script.
